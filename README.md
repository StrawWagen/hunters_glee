# Hunter's Glee

A **PVPVE survival gamemode** for Garry's Mod.

It's you (and your friends?) versus a variety of relentless enemies. Get close to hunting NPCs to earn score, then spend it all in the shop on weapons, beartraps, innate upgrades, and more.

But here's the twist: **the fun really begins when you die**. As a ghost, you unlock a whole new shop selection. Lock doors, place traps for your friends, or build a tempting supply room rigged with explosive barrels!

## Contributing

Hunter's Glee is designed to be extensible. The two main ways to add content are **shop items** and **spawnsets**.

### Adding Shop Items

Shop items are defined in `lua/glee_shopitems/`. Files are auto-loaded based on their prefix:
- `sh_` - Shared (runs on both client and server)
- `sv_` - Server only
- `cl_` - Client only

You can split logic between client and server.
Just variables starting with sv( svOnPurchaseFunc ) have to be defined on server!

#### Minimal Example

```lua
-- lua/glee_shopitems/sh_my_items.lua

local shopHelpers = GAMEMODE.shopHelpers

local items = {
    ["my_item_id"] = {
        name = "My Item",
        desc = "A description of what this item does.",
        shCost = 50,
        tags = { "ITEMS", "Weapon" },  -- Category tag, and misc tag (see below)
        purchaseTimes = {
            GAMEMODE.ROUND_INACTIVE,  -- Buyable during preparation
            GAMEMODE.ROUND_ACTIVE,    -- Buyable during the hunt
        },
        shPurchaseCheck = shopHelpers.aliveCheck,  -- Must be alive to buy
        svOnPurchaseFunc = function( purchaser )
            -- Server-side logic when purchased
            purchaser:Give( "weapon_pistol" )

        end,
    },
}

GAMEMODE:GobbleShopItems( items )
```

#### Shop Item Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | ✅ | Display name in the shop |
| `desc` | ✅ | Description (string or function) |
| `shCost` | ✅ | Cost in score (negative = gives score) |
| `tags` | ✅ | Category tags as indexed table (e.g., `{"ITEMS", "Weapon"}`) |
| `purchaseTimes` | ✅ | When purchasable: `ROUND_INACTIVE`, `ROUND_ACTIVE` |
| `svOnPurchaseFunc` | ✅ | Server function called on purchase: `function(purchaser, itemId)` |
| `shPurchaseCheck` | ❌ | Validation function(s): `function(purchaser) -> bool, reason` |
| `markup` | ❌ | Price multiplier during active hunt |
| `markupPerPurchase` | ❌ | Additional markup per purchase |
| `cooldown` | ❌ | Seconds between purchases (`math.huge` = once per round) |
| `weight` | ❌ | Sort order within category (lower = higher) |
| `shCanShowInShop` | ❌ | Visibility function: `function(purchaser) -> bool` |

#### Category Tags

Items appear in categories based on their first matching tag:

| Tag | Category | Visibility |
|-----|----------|------------|
| `ITEMS` | Items | Alive players |
| `INNATE` | Innate | Alive players |
| `DEADSACRIFICES` | Sacrifices | Dead players |
| `DEADGIFTS` | Gifts | Dead players |
| `BANK` | Bank | All players |

Additional descriptive tags (e.g., `"Weapon"`, `"Utility"`) don't affect categorization.

#### Shopping Helper Functions

`GAMEMODE.shopHelpers` provides common utilities:

```lua
shopHelpers.aliveCheck( purchaser )      -- Returns true if alive
shopHelpers.undeadCheck( purchaser )     -- Returns true if dead
shopHelpers.isCheats()                 -- Returns true if sv_cheats is on
shopHelpers.purchaseWeapon( purchaser, {
    class = "weapon_smg1",
    ammoType = "SMG1",
    purchaseClips = 4,      -- Clips given on first purchase
    resupplyClips = 2,      -- Clips given on repurchase
    confirmSoundWeight = 1, -- Gun cock sound intensity
} )
```

---

### Adding Spawnsets

Spawnsets define enemy waves and game parameters. They're defined in `lua/glee_spawnsets/` and auto-loaded.

#### Minimal Example

```lua
-- lua/glee_spawnsets/my_spawnset.lua

local mySpawnSet = {
    name = "my_spawnset",                    -- Unique identifier
    prettyName = "My Custom Mode",           -- Display name
    description = "A custom enemy configuration.",
    
    -- Use "default" to inherit base values, or "default*2" for multipliers
    difficultyPerMin = "default",
    waveInterval = "default",
    startingBudget = "default",
    maxSpawnCount = 8, -- 8 is pretty low, easy
    
    spawns = {
        {
            name = "hunter",                           -- Unique spawn identifier
            prettyName = "A Hunter",                   -- Display name
            class = "terminator_nextbot_snail",        -- Entity class to spawn
            spawnType = "hunter",                      -- Spawn type
            difficultyCost = { 10, 15 },               -- Cost range (random)
            countClass = "terminator_nextbot_snail*",  -- Pattern for counting (* = wildcard)
            minCount = { 1 },                          -- Always maintain this many
            maxCount = { 5 },                          -- Never exceed this many
        },
    },
}

table.insert( GLEE_SPAWNSETS, mySpawnSet )
```

#### Spawnset Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | ✅ | Unique identifier, should match filename |
| `prettyName` | ✅ | Display name for voting/UI |
| `description` | ✅ | Description shown to players |
| `spawns` | ✅ | Array of spawn definitions |
| `difficultyPerMin` | ❌ | How fast difficulty scales |
| `waveInterval` | ❌ | Time between spawn waves, skipped if all hunters are cleared |
| `diffBumpWhenWaveKilled` | ❌ | Difficulty boost when wave cleared |
| `startingBudget` | ❌ | Initial spawn budget |
| `spawnCountPerDifficulty` | ❌ | Spawns per difficulty point |
| `startingSpawnCount` | ❌ | Initial spawn count |
| `maxSpawnCount` | ❌ | Hard cap on enemy count |
| `maxSpawnDist` | ❌ | Hard cap on the dynamically marching spawn distance |
| `roundStartSound` | ❌ | Sound on round start |
| `roundEndSound` | ❌ | Sound on round end |
| `genericSpawnerRate` | ❌ | Crate/item spawn rate multiplier |
| `chanceToBeVotable` | ❌ | Percent chance to appear in !rtm vote, 0-100, accepts float |

Values can be:
- `"nil"` -- Use base spawnset value
- `"default"` - Explicity use base spawnset value
- `"default*N"` - Multiply base value by N
- `{ min, max }` - Random value in range
- Direct number - 8, 10, 11.25, etc ( not recommended, random value in range is much more fun )

#### Spawn Entry Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | ✅ | Unique identifier for this spawn entry |
| `prettyName` | ✅ | Display name |
| `class` | ✅ | Entity class to spawn |
| `spawnType` | ✅ | Spawning algorithm type, only supports `"hunter"` presently |
| `difficultyCost` | ✅ | Budget cost to spawn ( number or `{min, max}` ) |
| `countClass` | ✅ | Class pattern for counting ( `*` = wildcard ) |
| `minCount` | ❌ | Minimum maintained count |
| `maxCount` | ❌ | Maximum allowed count |
| `hardRandomChance` | ❌ | `{ min, max }` percent chance to even consider |
| `preSpawnedFuncs` | ❌ | Functions called before hunter:Spawn() : `function(spawnData, npc)` |
| `postSpawnedFuncs` | ❌ | Functions called after hunter:Spawn() : `function(spawnData, npc)` |

#### Example: Custom Behavior

```lua
-- lua/glee_spawnsets/the_true_machine.lua

local function applySynthflesh( spawnData, npc )
    npc:SetMaterial( "phoenix_storms/wire/pcb_red" )
end

local function announceArrival( spawnData, npc )
    huntersGlee_Announce( player.GetAll(), 100, 10, "The facade is gone.\nOnly the machine remains." )
end

local trueHorror = {
    name = "the_true_machine",
    prettyName = "The True Machine",
    description = "They've stopped pretending to be human.",
    difficultyPerMin = "default*1.5",
    waveInterval = "default",
    startingBudget = "default",
    maxSpawnCount = 6,
    chanceToBeVotable = 10,
    
    spawns = {
        {
            name = "synthflesh_terminator",
            prettyName = "Synthflesh Terminator",
            class = "terminator_nextbot_snail",
            spawnType = "hunter",
            difficultyCost = { 12, 18 },
            countClass = "terminator_nextbot_snail*",
            minCount = { 1 },
            maxCount = { 6 },
            postSpawnedFuncs = { applySynthflesh, announceArrival },
        },
    },
}

table.insert( GLEE_SPAWNSETS, trueHorror )
```
